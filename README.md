## Description

This application lets you make a list of notes to keep yourself organized. When you open the app there is a home page that has a button to start making notes. It leads you to the main page for creating content. This application can create notes, delete notes, and use existing notes as templates for new ones. When you start typing in the text fields a 'save note' button will appear. You can save the notes if both text fields have content, or you can clear the form and start again. Once the notes are in the sidebar you can click on them to be used as templates, or click the delete button to erase them.
